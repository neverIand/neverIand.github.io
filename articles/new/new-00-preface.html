        <section>
          <p>
            If anybody is reading this, hello and welcome. As what I said on the
            homepage, this is the 3rd iteration of my blog. So many things
            happened since I posted the last article on the first iteration.
          </p>

          <p>
            Basically what happened was: I started working on coursework and the
            summer project (AKA the final project) for my degree after I posted
            my last article on the blog v1.0. Then, I decided that I'll just
            rewrite my blog with web components and make it my final project.
            Surprisingly enough, I managed to get a degree, possibly due to no
            one knows what web components are and micro-frontend sounds very
            academic. The blog was under another domain name and my original
            plan was to update it so that I'll be actually willing to use it,
            because I can only post 'normal' blogposts and cannot edit the
            source code of a post directly. TLDR is this project still sucks and
            probably looks even work than v1.0. Then I somehow found a job, and
            the plan to update blog v2.0 was halted.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be honest, I'm not exactly sure why I want to use web compnents,
            probably because I'm informed of its existence at the last minute of
            my bachelor FYP, which is a porject about micro-frontend and
            micro-service where I am supposed (?) to use web components instead
            of a single-spa based framework. But after becoming a little bit
            more experienced, frankly speaking, I feel like I am kind of getting
            it - web component requires no dependency and is essentially vanilla
            js. Unlike many frameworks/libraries, vanilla js evolves very slowly
            and is (and probably always will be) the prerequisite for many
            frontend frameworks. After getting so many dependencies in many
            other projects I'm involved, I want to do something much simpler - a
            website that's more vanilla and might be closer to what the web was
            supposed to be, where HTML markup remains markup, CSS remains CSS
            and not configurations in js, and js scripts are just... scripts.
            Also, this time I'm using Github Pages, so hopefully I can focus
            more on updating the blog itself than finding the password of my
            server portal every time I updated the code and need to redeploy.

            So, this is how this site come into being. This time, hopefully,
            I'll be less lazy and occasionally update it. It is a bit sad that
            some of the things I wanted to write down during the downtime didn't
            make it, but it's never too late to start it all over again. It's
            also quite funny to look at my very own code almost 3 years ago and
            some of my blogposts (The
            <a href="/articles/archived/others-002-on-the-way-home.html"
              >GTA Online one</a
            >
            aged poorly lol). I hope I can continue to make more progress in
            general so that maybe 2 or 3 years later, I can have the exact same
            feeling again looking at my own work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Btw, the site is still a work in progress and there are several
            components on the roadmap before I start figuring out how to make it
            look better. My current priority for site functionality is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a custom image component</li>
            <li>a code snippet component (if I can figure it out)</li>
            <li>
              improve
              <a href="https://web.dev/articles/vitals" target="_blank">CLS</a>,
              this will likely involve some refactor
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Then, I'll look into dark mode and a better design. Let's see how it
            goes.
