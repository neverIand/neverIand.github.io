My interest in frontend techs originated from year 3 in my bachelor degree, where I chose the computer graphics course instead of database. I find it very appealing and did pretty well in that module, but unfortunately there wasn't a follow-up module in year 4 and I have to dedicate all of my time to not only ordinary courses but also FYP, so I didn't pick up computer graphics afterwards. However, to me, frontend related stuff is kind of related to computer graphics, so I picked microservices and micro frontend as my FYP. <s>I was clueless how much pain it was going to bring</s></p><p>Aside from making websites, I'm also into doing simple video editing and collecting CDs. I do like making my own Lego MOCs once upon a time, but now there are simply too many things on my side project TODO list that I barely have any time for other stuff (More on side projects below).</p><p>Games I play: GTAOL, Minecraft (EnigTech 2, recently <a href="https://github.com/TerraFirmaGreg-Team/Modpack-1.20.x/tree/main" target="_blank">TerraFirmaGreg1.20.x</a>), L4D2, DST, ETS 2 (very casual)</p></section><section><h2>Projects</h2><ul><li>This blog</li><li><a class="project-link" href="https://www.tangyizhe.com/rank" target="_blank">N3K0</a>: a page I made for my friend who has his own animation ranking database. For now only admin can add entry and sign-up endpoint is disabled (if my memory is correct). I used this project to learn MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)</li><li><a class="project-link" href="https://ozrcyde.com/post">A site that allows users to create Instagram-like posts</a> (I call it 'Instagram at home'). This is a site I build for my cousin but she is simply too busy to actually use it or give feedback. Also, I still haven't managed to persuade her that it makes no sense to upload a 50MB photo to this website.</li><li><a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/neverIand/Modpack-1.20.x-CN/tree/main">Mandarin translation for TerraFirmaGreg Modpack Questline</a>: the modpack I'm recently playing with my friends. The translation progress will follow our game progress, though I heard that someone already uploaded the complete translation. With that said, my translation for the primitive age quest line got accepted by the mod author, so who knows.</li><li><a href="https://www.instinctmethod.com" class="project-link">Instinct Method</a>: an App for learning English. I contributed to many of the translation work involved and internal content generation.</li><li>You can see my other archived projects on <a href="https://github.com/neverIand" target="_blank">Github</a>. Most of them are courseworks in my bachelor/master years.</li><li>There are at least one reasonably sized side project I haven't mentioned but it's not about software dev. I might put it here later.</li></ul></section><section><h2>Random Links</h2><p>These are non-software related content (mostly).</p><div class="external-link"><a href="https://www.role2.com/R4TCH3T" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Role2</a><p>A small social networking site made by my friend. It may not be obvious, but it has a lot of interesting features. I would say it's underrated.</p></div><div class="external-link"><a href="https://www.pixiv.net/users/14482874" target="_blank">Pixiv</a><p>Did I mention that I can also draw once upon a time? Now I only use Miro and diagrams.net those kind of stuff, sadge. Also, it has the screenshots of my computer graphics courseworks. I might upload them to Github as well later.</p></div><div class="external-link"><a href="https://space.bilibili.com/13676288" target="_blank">[Mandarin] Bilibili</a><p>I don't really like this site, and I only upload more 'serious' videos. In fact, most of my video uploaded to this site are actually comissioned by my friend who asked me to edit his <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/1756631" target="_blank">gaming vids</a>. It's easy to tell which ones are done by me: those with music in them and have higher views.</p></div><div class="external-link"><a href="https://www.acfun.cn/u/16013750" target="_blank">[Mandarin] AcFun</a><p>All my videos including some unedited minecraft and L4D2 playthroughs, which can help with insomnia.</p></div><div class="external-link"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPMeZwiK_0uw13cQDy9IzSg" target="_blank">Youtube Main Channel</a><p>A very imcomplete collection of videos I made.
