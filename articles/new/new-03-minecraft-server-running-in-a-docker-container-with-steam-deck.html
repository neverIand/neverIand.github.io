        <section>
          <p>
            Welcome to part 2 of the series. In this article, I'll explain how
            to run a (modded) minecraft server using docker on a steam deck. You
            can find part 1
            <a href="/articles/new/new-02-install-docker-on-a-steam-deck.html"
              >here</a
            >
            where I go through how to install Docker on a steam deck step by
            step.
          </p>
          <p>
            More specifically, I'll run the server version of
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/TerraFirmaGreg-Team/Modpack-1.20.x/tree/main"
              >TerraFirmaGreg - 1.20.x</a
            >, a modpack I'm playing with my friends recently.

          <h5>Step 1: Assemble the command</h5>
          <p>
            The image I used was
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
              >docker-minecraft-server</a
            >. To improve readability, I'll show the
            <code>docker-compose.yml</code> as well. But in reality, if you
            really want to use <code>docker-compose</code>,
            <b>you'll need to install it on the steam deck yourself</b> - The
            linux version of docker doesn't come with
            <code>docker-compose</code>, and I'm just going to run this one
            instance anyway so I just used the equivalent command.
          </p>

          <p>Several things worth mentioning here:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <code>image</code>: I used the tag <code>java17</code> after the
              image name because I've run into some issues with this modpack
              when using JDK 21.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>TYPE</code>: This image features auto-downloading mods or
              modpacks from several sources. Since the modpack I play is
              available on CurseForge, I set it to <code>AUTO_CURSEFORGE</code>.
              You can find other configurable sources
              <a
                href="https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mods-and-plugins/"
                >here</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>CF_API_KEY</code>: You'll need a CurseForge API key to be
              able to download the mods automatically when creating the
              container. You can get one
              <a target="_blank" href="https://console.curseforge.com/">here</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>CF_PAGE_URL</code>: This image supports multiple url formats
              to specify which mod you want to download. I chose this format
              because I can make it download this particular file so that I'm
              100% sure the version I use is correct. In order to find such
              link, You need to go the mods page and switch to the
              <b>Files</b> tab. Then, click on the file you want to download and
              you can see the url in browser's address bar.
              <berry-img
                data-title="Go to the Files tab"
                data-src="/articles/images/new/03/files.jpg"
              ></berry-img>
              <berry-img
                data-title="Use link of the page"
                data-src="/articles/images/new/03/link.jpg"
              ></berry-img>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>CF_EXCLUDE_MODS</code>: If you are lucky, this field is
              <b>not</b> needed at all. The reason I had to add this config is
              that several <b>client</b> mods in this modpack are mislabeled as
              <b>server</b> mods, causing the server unable to start up. If
              similar thing happens to you and the container stopped, My
              suggestion is that you go through the error logs and ignore the
              stack traces - only pay attention to the mods that failed to load
              (if any) first. In my case, the mods that failed to load were
              blur, Rrls, ItemPhysicsLite. Then, go to CurseForge, search for
              these mods one by one and add their project id to this field. The
              screenshot below demonstrates how to find the project id of a mod:
              <berry-img
                data-src="/articles/images/new/03/project_id.jpg"
              ></berry-img>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You can find the explanation of the rest of the configuration in the
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
              >official docs</a
            >
            of docker-minecraft-server.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>Step 2: Run the command</h5>
          <p>
            With all the configuration out of the way and the command ready, now
            you can finally start the server:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Go to the where you want to store the server data and create a new
              folder, e.g. <code>tfg-server</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right click and open the command line tool (e.g. Konsole) here,
              then run the command. If you are using
              <code>docker-compose</code>, you'll need to copy the
              <code>docker-compose.yml</code> to this folder you've just created
              and then run <code>docker-compose up -d --force-recreate</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              It will now start downloading all the dependencies and do all
              kinds of installation. Use
              <code>docker logs tfg-server -f</code> to see the container logs
              in real time (remember to replace <code>tfg-server</code> with you
              own container name).
            </li>
            <li>
              Usually you can ignore all the warning (or even error) messages it
              prints, but if the container somehow stopped, you'll have to go
              through the errors like I did above and figure out the issues
              yourself. Good luck!ðŸ«¡
            </li>
            <li>
              In my case, the terminal looked something like this when the
              server started properly:
              <berry-img
                data-title="Yours might be different depending on the Minecraft version you use."
                data-src="/articles/images/new/03/server_running.jpg"
              ></berry-img>
              <berry-img
                data-title="Joining the server on my laptop"
                data-src="/articles/images/new/03/join_the_server_on_my_laptop.jpg"
              ></berry-img>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            And that's it. I won't cover port forwarding because I don't have
            the router's password of the room I'm livingðŸ« . You can only start a
            LAN server by following this guide (which is the real difficult part
            from my perspective). With that said, I may try to install
            <code>docker-compose</code> and experiment with some other stuff in
            the future.
