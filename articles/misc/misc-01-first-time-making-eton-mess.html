            My British friend recommended me this dessert since berries are
            in-season right now. Also it's very easy to make, which is
            definitely a good news to someone like me who barely knows how to
            cook (or bake). This is the receipe I used:

          <berry-code data-title="Ingredients I actually used" nohighlight>
            <pre slot="code">
400g strawberries

4 meringue cookies (3 or even 2 should be enough)

3-4 Tbsp sugar

300ml whipping cream
            </pre>
          </berry-code>

          <p>
            The meringue cookies I got from Morrisons are huge (see the photo
            below) so I smacked more cookies than needed. I also forgot to the
            the lemon juice but luckily (or unluckily) the strawberry I got was
            not that sweet, so I guess it balanced out.
          </p>

            To me, the hardest part is actually whipping the cream. I have never
            whipped cream before myself, only watched others doing it. First
            time was a failure, the cream barely changed its form after several
            minutes of whipping and stiring. I then took a closer look at the
            tutorial and tried to shake the mixer a little bit when whipping,
            and eventually it worked.
          </p>

          ></berry-img>

          <p>
            It was really good, and since I still have some whipping cream left,
            I'll probably make it again with some other berries as well.
