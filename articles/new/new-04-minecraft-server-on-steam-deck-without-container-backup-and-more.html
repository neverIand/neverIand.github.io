          <p>
            It's hard to believe I'm writing a third blogpost in this series.
            Anyway, this time I will document how I transfered our own save to
            the test server I
            <a
              href="./new-03-minecraft-server-running-in-a-docker-container-with-steam-deck.html"
              >previously set up on steam deck</a
            >, along with how to upgrade the server version (you probably
            already figured it out yourself), how to run a minecraft server
            without using docker, and an extremely unscientific testing in terms
            of server performance on both methods.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>Loading saves and access server terminal</h5>
          <p>
            I aksed my friend (i.e. server owner) to send me our own saves for
            me to test. In our case (TFG1.20.x), all necessary files are in
            <code>/world</code> folder, so I only need to overwrite the exact
            same folder in the container's volume. I was a bit nervous at first
            because our world was under modpack version 0.6.15 while the version
            hosted in the container is 0.7.7. Luckliy, there weren't any issue
            and the server succesfully started again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another reason my friend sent me the save was that we want to see
            how the server perform, but because this is still a relatively niche
            modpack (for now), there isn't any existing saves made by others for
            testing purpose. For context, at later stages of such modpack,
            there'll be tons of multiblock structures and automated pipeline,
            which will definitly have performance requirments on the server
            hardware. Therefore, we can only use our own game saves to test the
            performance for now. There was another small issue though: I'm
            logging in as a new player, so I have an empty inventory and am at
            spawn. Our in-game base is thousands of blocks away and I don't want
            to walk all the way there in survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, in order to change the game mode, I have to make myself
            an op. I know almost nothing to minecraft server commands before, so
            it took me a little while to figure things out. Since we are using
            docker, we need to access the server console first (don't forget to
            replace the container name with your own):
          </p>
          <berry-code data-title="Command" nohighlight>
            <pre slot="code">
docker exec -it tfg-server rcon-cli
            </pre>
          </berry-code>
          <p>
            Then you can run any kinds of server command you want. In this case,
          </p>
          <berry-code data-title="Command" nohighlight>
            <pre slot="code">
/op playername
            </pre>
          </berry-code>
          <p>
            Now, I can finally change the game mode to creative and teleport to
            our base.
          </p>

            data-title="It feels really nice to see our base again"

          <h5>Run the server on steam deck directly</h5>
          <p>
            I got asked when I was trying to install docker on my SD: why not
            just run the server directly? Well, yes, I use docker because this
            is just an excuse for me to learn and use docker. Since we want to
            do a simple performance comparison later, I took the chance to
            install JDK on my SD as well. Originally I considered to use the JDK
            downloaded by
            <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank"
              >Prism Launcher</a
            >, but since these kind of lauchers typically manage games by
            <b>instances</b>, meaning that if I delete the game instance, the
            JDK in that instance will also be removed, and I need to download
            and add JDK to the path again. So I just installed JDK using
            <a href="https://github.com/BlackCorsair/install-jdk-on-steam-deck"
              >this script</a
            >:
          </p>
          <berry-code data-title="Command" nohighlight>
            <pre slot="code">
git clone https://github.com/BlackCorsair/install-jdk-on-steam-deck.git && \
JDK_VERSION=17 ./install-jdk-on-steam-deck/scripts/install-jdk.sh
            </pre>
          </berry-code>
          <p>
            Then you can run <code>java -version</code> to verify the
            installation.
          </p>
          <p>
            With java installed, I can now execute the jar file in the server
            version of the modback:
          </p>
          <berry-code data-title="Command" nohighlight>
            <pre slot="code">
java -jar minecraft_server.jar -Xmx8192M -Xms1024M nogui
            </pre>
          </berry-code>
          <p>
            (This only applies to this modpack and to be honest, I don't know
            whether other modpacks works similarly.)
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>A very unscientific performance comparison</h5>
          <p>
            The test itself has already been very unscientific given the lack of
            a more comprehensive save file, and it became even more unscientific
            after I discovered that I wasn't able to iteract with any block in
            our base because it's claimed by my friend. Therefore, all machines
            in our base will only run for a very short period and then stop due
            to lack of power source. Anyway, I mangaged to run
            <code>/forge tps</code> before all machines have stopped in the
            non-container version:
          </p>
          <berry-img
            data-title="Outside container"
            data-src="/articles/images/new/04/native_20240518164418.jpg"
          ></berry-img>
          <berry-img
            data-title="Inside container"
            data-src="/articles/images/new/04/container_20240518155640.jpg"
          ></berry-img>
          <p>
            As you can see, the difference is almost neglectable due to lack of
            performance pressure - both game runs at 20 tps. But, if the result
            is to be believed, then the non-container version is a bit faster.
            The gap will definitely be larger with the progression of the game,
            so I might test it again in the future.
          </p>

          <h5>Upgrade the modpack</h5>
          <p>
            Transferring the save from 0.6.15 to 0.7.7 technically is a server
            upgrade. Frankly speaking, I haven't come up with a better way than
            just recreating the container and then transfer the saves (if
            necessary at all). If you also use docker compose, you only need to
            replace the <code>CF_PAGE_URL</code> with the newer version of the
            modpack, just as running the <code>docker run</code> command
            directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might still too early to draw the conclusion since my friends and
            I are still in early game, but I do think using docker to run a
            minecraft server is a bit overkill - unless you need to manage
            multiple server instances or create a image that contains the save
            files.
          </p>
