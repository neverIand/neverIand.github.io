          <p>A while ago someone in a group chat asked:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              I have an array of numbers, and I want to check whether all
              elements in it are the same. Is there a better way than just
              iterate through it?
              <span class="text-muted"
                >[function that iterates through the array that compares each
                item with the previous one]</span
              >
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Soon people in the chat suggested 4 solutions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Essentially the same solution but use
              <code>array.every()</code> (later due some reason it got changed
              to using the ordinary for loop, I'll explain)
            </li>
            <li>
              Convert the array to a <code>Set</code> and check its size (I came
              up with this one btw)
            </li>
            <li>Check<code>Math.max(array)===Math.min(array)</code></li>
            <li>Use <code>array.join()</code> and compare two strings (wat)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            We made some <i>interesting</i> discovery later but before we get
            ahead of ourselves let's briefly discuss the differences between
            these solutions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h6>Method 1</h6>
          <p>
            The idea behind it is very straightforward: iterating through the
            whole array is good enough because it's O(n) in the worst case. To
            make the code simpler and faster with early termination, initially
            the suggestion was to use <code>array.every()</code>:
          </p>

          <berry-code data-title="Using array.every()">
            <pre slot="code">
let result = arr.every((val) => val === arr[0]);
console.log(result);
            </pre>
          </berry-code>

          <p>
            Skip ahead a little we discovered that this is actually slower than
            an ordinary for loop (more on that later), so it became:
          </p>

          <berry-code data-title="Using normal for loop">
            <pre slot="code">
let same = true;
for (let index = 0; index &lt; arr.length; index++) {
  if (arr[0] != arr[index]) {
    same = false;
    break;
  }
}
console.log(same);
            </pre>
          </berry-code>
          <p>
            This means the loop will terminate early if it detects the
            non-equivalent value. Pros: simple, good readability, fast (or is
            it?). Cons: only works for numerical arrays (but that's just what we
            need so this doesn't count)
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h6>Method 2</h6>
          <p>
            It's very simple to convert an array into a <code>Set</code> in
            javascript and by definition of a set, we'll only have unique
            elements in it, so:
          </p>

          <berry-code data-title="Using Set">
            <pre slot="code">
let result = new Set(arr).size === 1;
console.log(result);
            </pre>
          </berry-code>

          <p>
            Pros: simple, good readability, works for array of any types. Cons:
            could cause OOM (Out of Memory, I hate buzzwords) if the array is
            huge, and is slightly less efficient for large arrays due to the
            overhead of creating a new <code>Set</code>(or is it?).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h6>Method 3</h6>
          <p>
            Yet another straightforward method: a numerical array with all
            identical items will have the same maximum value and minimum value:
          </p>

          <berry-code data-title="Checking MinMax">
            <pre slot="code">
let result = Math.max(...arr) === Math.min(...arr);
console.log(result);
            </pre>
          </berry-code>

          <p>
            Pros: simple, good readability, fast. Cons: only works for numerical
            arrays (...)
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h6>Method 4 <span class="text-error">(Don't use it)</span></h6>
          <p>
            I'm not sure why that person decide to come up with this method but
            aside from being indirect and ineffecient, this just returns wrong
            results in some cases - an array like <code>[11, 111]</code> will
            produce the same string as <code>[111, 11]</code>. I'm not even
            going to show the sample code.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h6>Why I decide to write an article about it</h6>
          <p>
            After first person replied with method 1, I asked him if there'll be
            any issue using <code>Set</code> (Now we already know). However, to
            prove his point, he decide to write a demo, and then it turns out
            that using <code>Set</code> is actually faster - by a lot (in the
            worst case scenario at least.). It's very likely that
            <code>array.every()</code> has some additional logic under the hood,
            so he tried to use a normal for loop instead. However, constucting a
            <code>Set</code> is still faster in this case, and the difference
            becomes more significant once the array size increases:
          </p>
          <berry-code data-title="Demo (Worst Case)" runnable>
            <pre slot="code">
let arr = Array(100000).fill(1);
arr.push(2);

// Set
const st1 = performance.now();
let r1 = new Set(arr).size === 1;
const et1 = performance.now();

console.log("Set:", r1);
console.log(`Elapsed time: ${et1 - st1} milliseconds`);

// Math.max
const st2 = performance.now();
let r2 = Math.max(...arr) === Math.min(...arr);
const et2 = performance.now();

console.log("MinMax:", r2);
console.log(`Elapsed time: ${et2 - st2} milliseconds`);

// for loop
const st3 = performance.now();
let r3 = true;
for (let index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {
  if (arr[0] != arr[index]) {
    r3 = false;
    break;
  }
}
const et3 = performance.now();

console.log("OG for:", r3);
console.log(`Elapsed time: ${et3 - st3} milliseconds`);

// arr.every
const st4 = performance.now();
let r4 = arr.every((val) => val === arr[0]);
const et4 = performance.now();

console.log("array.every:", r4);
console.log(`Elapsed time: ${et4 - st4} milliseconds`);
            </pre>
          </berry-code>

          <p>
            On my machine, using <code>Set</code> or <code>Math.min()</code> can
            either be the fastest one, then the old-school for loop followed by
            <code>array.every()</code>. Of course, you can try it out yourself
            and see if the result is any different.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's hard to draw a real conclusion from it because at this scale,
            such kind of optimization can be easily overshadowed by the
            underlying implementation of javascript engine. For this particular
            problem, using <code>Math.min()</code> seems to be the most
            efficient way, but depending on the real-world use case, if early
            termination is likely to happen, for-loop is also a decent choice. I
            guess it does prove that in order to fully optimize a function,
            you'll need to target the specifics of that problem eventually,
            though that will probably means the solution will be less
            general-purpose.
