        <section>
          <p>
            It's been a while since my last post and I've been busy with so many
            things behind the scene (mainly finding a new job and moving to
            LDN). Now that most of my irl stuff has finally settled, I'm
            planning to convert the things I did during this period to blog
            posts, that is if I feel like those topics/projects are in a
            reasonable state (which means I may not write about them at all, but no
            one is gonna read them so who cares).
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyways, first part of this article is essentially a reminder for
            myself so that next time when I update the gh actions of this site I
            can make less silly mistake.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            To be clear, I don't think it's necessary to setup caching for this
            site - it is a static site after all and it doesn't even use npm. It
            only uses some 'dependencies' in github action for minimizing
            Javascript and CSS. Particularly, I haven't noticed significant
            deployment speed different after caching is implemented, so this is
            only for learning purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            Adding caching itself is not that complicated, but it does mean I
            need to make this project an npm project by running
            <code>npm init -y</code> and add packages needed for minifying to
            local dependency. Since the gh action needs to run
            <code>npm ci</code>, and npm is pointing me with a gun to init the
            project locally before running that command.
          </p>

          <p>Things to check (because I'm stupid):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Whether the action is running on the correct branch</li>
            <li>
              Node version - github runners will complain if node version
              doesn't match
            </li>
            <li>
              make sure to use <code>find</code> command to recursively find js
              and css files
            </li>
            <li>
              REPLACE the original css and js files after minimizing because I'm
              not replacing their reference in HTML
            </li>
            <li>
              If the code is not minified, again, check if the workflow is
              running on the right branch and if the correct branch is being
              deployed. Then, check the gh-pages branch and see if the minified
              files are present.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

            In terms of future blog posts, I think I still need more time
            because I'm not satisfied with the status of all of these things,
            but I do hope I can write about all of them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Improvements to the code snippet component
              <code>&lt;berry-code&gt;</code>. This is mostly done and I'll
              probably reflect on it first if I figure out a way to make more
              'progressive enhancements' to it.
            </li>
            <li>
              My first electron app. This will likely be a painful story to tell
              - it's already functional but I really want to add some more
              quality of life improvements so that it's actually serviceable.
            </li>
            <li>
              My reflection on writing a mini React following a tutorial. I'll
              probably need to do that tutorial again since it's been a while.
            </li>
            <li>
              My first browser plugin. I doubt it will actually come to fruition
              though.
            </li>
          </ul>
