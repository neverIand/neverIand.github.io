However, if that is not possible, there are several alternatives:</p><ul><li>Remove the classes affected by the vulnerability if those classes are not used by the software (<b>needs to be confirmed by vendors</b>). This can be done manually or via <a href="https://github.com/logpresso/CVE-2021-44228-Scanner" target="_blank" title="CVE-2021-44228-Scanner">other tools</a>. Still, this does <b>not</b> update the log4j itself so it won't make the SEoL warning go away.</li><li>Use the bridge provided by log4j 2 as stated above (or see this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26005149/mixing-log4j-1-x-and-log4j-2?rq=4" target="_blank" title="Mixing log4j 1.x and log4j 2">stackoverflow answer</a>). However, this method has its <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/migrate-from-log4j1.html#option-1-use-the-log4j-1-x-bridge-log4j-1-2-api" target="_blank" title="Log4j 1 to Log4j 2 bridge">limitations</a>.</li><li>Use a Java decompiler to modify the source code and save those changes so that the original software will be using log4j 2. However, this method is <b>not</b> recommended, not only because of the amount of manual effort and the potential errors it may come with, but also the requirements running the decompiler. At the time of writing, the only free Java decompiler that's capable of recompiling is <a href="https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf" target="_blank" title="Recaf">Recaf</a> and it requires JDK 22 to run, which means it's also compulsory to modify the server which runs a much older version of OpenJDK.</li></ul><p>Note that log4j 2 is <b>not</b> backward compatible with log4j 1, so it's impossible to update the package by replacing the original files directly, especially since we don't have access to source code.</p><p>For the log4j dependency in Doxis FIPS, the process mentioned above (i.e. replace the original file with 3 bridge files) should be able to resolve the issue. In fact, this is also the <a href="https://servicedesk.sergroup.com/help/en-us/46-security-advisories/150-apache-log4j-v2-cve-2021-44228-cve-2021-45046-cve-2021-45105" target="_blank" title="Apache log4j v2 CVE-2021-44228 / CVE-2021-45046 / CVE-2021-45105">method recommended by SER</a>.</p></section><section><h5>Dealing with Sage CrystalReport</h5><p>CrystalReport's situation is more complicated because there's also an outdated log4j located in the axis2 package according to the scanner, so there are actually 2 ways to update:</p><ul><li>Update the axis 2 package itself to a version that uses log4j 2, or</li><li>Only update the log4j dependency inside the axis2</li></ul><p>However, updating axis2 appears to be a more risky option because axis2 only started to use log4j 2 from version <a href="https://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/release-notes/1.8.0.html" target="_blank" title="Apache Axis2 1.8.0 Release Note">1.8.0</a> and there are breaking changes introduced in version <a href="https://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/release-notes/1.7.0.html" target="_blank" title="Apache Axis2 1.7.0 Release Note">1.7.0</a>. Since CrystalReport uses version 1.6.2, updating to 1.8 will be a big leap and might cause unexpected result.</p><p>Another reason for using the bridge is that this is actually how the authors of axis2 migrated to log4j 2 themselves: by searching for log4j references in axis2 v1.8's dependencies (<a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/axis2/axis2/1.8.1/axis2-1.8.1.pom" target="_blank">pom.xml</a>), it can be observed that bridge related files are present, and 2 additional packages are included: <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-slf4j-impl" target="_blank" title="Apache Log4j SLF4J Binding">log4j-slf4j-impl</a> and <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-jcl" target="_blank" title="Apache Log4j Commons Logging Bridge">log4j-jcl</a>. Therefore, using the log4j bridge looks like a more reasonable approach.</p><p>In additional to the nested dependency from axis2, Sage also used a 3rd party build system <a href="https://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank" title="Apache Ant - Welcome">Apache Ant</a> to build their project and manage packages, which can be observed in the <code>MANIFEST.MF</code> file in its packages. Therefore, after replacing the old log4j file with 5 files (3 required ones and the two mentioned above), the reference to the old log4j in <code>Bundle-ClassPath</code> inside <code>MANIFEST.MF</code> also needs to be changed to <code>log4j-1.2-api-2.17.1.jar</code>.</p><p>Finally, there's another old log4j in the same directory as axis2 but it may not get picked up by scanners. If it's required to patch that as well, replace it with those 3 files and change the reference in <code>MANIFEST.MF</code> like above should also work.</p></section><berry-date></berry-date></article><script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="neverIand/neverIand.github.io" issue-term="url" theme="preferred-color-scheme" crossorigin="anonymous" async></script></main><berry-toolbar></berry-toolbar><berry-toast></berry-toast><berry-footer></berry-footer></body></html>
