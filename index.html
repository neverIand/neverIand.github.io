            You can still read the archived articles ported from the old version
            of the project, though they are in mandarin and you'll probably need
            machine translation.

          This is the 3rd iteration of my blog. I may post something relevant to
          tech and other random stuff here.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case you wonder, the first iteration is written in php and you can
          have a glimpse <a href="#archive">here</a>. The second iteration works
          fine but I just decided to throw it away, and now I
          <a href="/articles/new/new-00-preface.html">end up here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Use <code>Ctrl + f</code> to search for content. Where's tagging
          and SEO and all those stuff? The answer is no because this is my
          website and I can do whatever I want. If someone really wants to find
          something and is willing to jump into the rabbit hole, he will find it
          eventually.
